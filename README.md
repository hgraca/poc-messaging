# Messaging POC

This project is a POC for the integration between different platforms, using a Message Queue and, at some point, RPC.

At the moment, the different platforms are built using C#, C++, Rust and PHP.

All artifacts that relate to all projects should be placed at the root of the project, and artifacts related 
only to one of the languages, should be placed in the corresponding language.
